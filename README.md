# learning-python

This repository contains my Python learning journey as a beginner. It includes basic to intermediate concepts such as:

- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and recursion
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Decorators (`@property`, `@classmethod`)
- Simple games (Snake Water Gun)
- Unit converters and calculators

Each file is a mini-project or practice script for mastering specific topics in Python.
