# 🐍 learning-python

Welcome to my Python learning journey!  
This repository contains a collection of simple and beginner-friendly Python programs that I’ve created while learning the language.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- ✅ Basic input/output and variables  
- 🔁 Loops (`for`, `while`) and conditional statements  
- 🧮 Functions and recursion (factorial, sum of numbers, etc.)  
- 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (classes, `@property`, `@classmethod`)  
- 🎮 Mini projects (Snake Water Gun game)  
- 🔢 Unit converters (temperature, currency, length)  
- 📐 Math operations (square, cube, root functions)

## 💻 Purpose:
This repo serves as my personal practice ground to strengthen my Python basics, build confidence in programming, and prepare myself for AIML projects and internships.

## 🚀 Next Goals:
- Practice more real-world mini-projects  
- Start working with data using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`  
- Explore beginner-level machine learning concepts

## 📅 Started:
**July 2025**
